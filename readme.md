# Korris - A mixture of Corne, Kyria and Ferris

This is the keyboard design files for my own use, inspired by
[crkbd](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd),
[Kyria](https://blog.splitkb.com/blog/introducing-the-kyria) and
[Ferris](https://github.com/pierrechevalier83/ferris).

I like the simplicity of Corne, however, the more aggresive column stagger
on Kyria suits my hand better. I also removed the use of pro micro boards, and
used the same design in Ferris 2.0: a chip on the main side, and a IO expander
on the secondary side. 

## Summary of board features

* Audio buzzer
* Rotary encoder
* Underglow RGB LEDs
* SMT32 MCU
* Column stagger similar to Kyria.
* Corne-style thumb cluster with extra inner key: I feel Kyria's thumb cluster 
is too much and the outer column is hard to reach for me. 
* Thumb cluster shifted 0.25u to the middle.
* TRRS jack moved to face top like Ferris. This would allow me to use touchpad
if the boards are used with a laptop.
